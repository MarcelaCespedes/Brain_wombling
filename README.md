# Brain_wombling
This repository provides users full access to the brain wombling model described in the manuscript titles *Baeysian hierarchical models detect differences in cortical thickness and networks along progression towards Alzheimer's disease*, available here (insert EPubs link), submitted to NeuroImage journal.

Intention for this repository is to provide the R code to implement brain wombling on simulated data.

This repository contains 
1. The R code for simuation of data, accortding to the methods described in the paper, on 35 ROI's.
2. Results from an earlier run, and plots from the processed MCMC chains.

In the manuscript, the brain wombling was applied on the Australian Imaging, Biomarker's and Lifestyle longitudinal study of ageing ([AIBL](https://aibl.csiro.au/research/support/)) data. Refer to link for request to access the data. Alternatively, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is another world class ongoing longitudinal study of ageing, whose objectives include making data available to the scientific community without embargo. For more information see Weiner, Michael W., et al. "The Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative: A review of papers published since its inception." Alzheimer's & Dementia 8.1 (2012): S1-S68. For data aquisition details see this [link](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/).

### Future work
Potential extension to the algorithm are described in the Discussion section of the manuscript. 
An extension which led to *dynamic wombling* will be included in it's own repository and available soon from the author.
